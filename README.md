# My .dotfiles setup

## TODO/FIXME

 * Check `terminfo` install. ___Because___ I haven't tested a fresh install in a while.
 * Install a nerdfont. ___Because___ extra symbols/icons are needed for plugins. Currently the install is manual.
 * Add kitty config ___Because___ it works better than Alacritty on linux and may be a good mac option too
 * Fix tmux config. ___Because___ `reattach-to-user-namespace` is mac-only and breaks tmux
 * Upgrade move-line.lua to be `<cmd>` friendly ___Because___ `<cmd>` is neater and more performant, but does not understand `'<,'>` marks (intentional, see `:help <Cmd>`)
 * Simplify `nvim-dap` config ___Because___ it currently is limited, depends on an extra plugin, and is hard-coded to work with a Parcel application
 * Replace `vim-surround` ___Because___ there are some newer alternatives with nicer APIs/key bindings
