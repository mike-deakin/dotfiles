## TODO/FIXME

 * [nvim] Replace `vim-surround` ___Because___ there are some newer alternatives with nicer APIs/key bindings
 * [nvim] Look at vim-snip alternatives ___Because___ lua is cool
 * [nvim] Improve completion bindings ___Because___ its much better, but I still make mistakes
 * [nvim] Consider [caskey](https://github.com/Nexmean/caskey.nvim) ___Because___ it looks like a neat way of organising bindings
 * [zsh] Create a pseudo-mode for easier pane navigation. [A potentially useful gist.](https://gist.github.com/samoshkin/05e65f7f1c9b55d3fc7690b59d678734) ___Because___ pressing <C-b> every time is a bit annoying and I'd like some vim-like movement.
